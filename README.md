## I am retiring this version of the app, because of the deprecation of openGL on macOS making it have unexpected behaviors every now and then, but will recode it in c++ using the Vulkan api
### I may however update this project again, as openGL is only deprecated on macOS and not on linux, the likeliness of it is quite slim though



this is the first project of the graphics branch at 42
this is the current advancement of the project :

# Mandatory : 
 - [x] loading a 3d object
 - [x] the object can be translated in three dimensions
 - [ ] the object rotates around itself
 - [ ] applying a texture to the object
 - [ ] having a perspective

# bonus : 
- [x] render several objects
- [ ] make it so that the textures are not stretched
- [ ] correctly rendering "weird" object files
- [ ] global illumination / shadows
